**AgriConnect - Connect Farmers & Expertise Digitally**  

The proposed system aims to provide a user-friendly digital platform for farmers to submit and manage crop details efficiently, provide farmers with access to crop data from other districts for insights and best practices. Also, to facilitate knowledge-sharing and collaboration among farmers and agricultural experts through a discussion section on the platform. The system has been built using Express.js, React.js & Node.js. MongoDB is used as a database management system. The website contains a field “Sowing Guide” where farmers can view various bar graphs which is representation of Crops Sown vs Geographical Region of that state. Along with this user can submit pesticide details (Name of pesticide, how to use it, type of pesticide, etc.); these details are further saved in the database. The website contains a field “Pesticide Guide” where user needs to just enter the crop name & can get all suitable pesticides for that crop in the form of a table. This pesticide which user can see are the same which were submitted by other users in “Submit Pesticide” section. The platform contains a discussion forum, where farmers can post the blog, reply to others blogs & can thus have effective communication. Overall, “AgriConnect” stands as a beacon of innovation in the agricultural landscape, it helps farmers to  manage their crops better, learn from each other, and access important information easily.
